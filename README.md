## Fillit

This projects seeks to make us discover and/or familiarize us to a recurring
problematic in programming: searching for the optimal solution among a huge
set of possibilities.

In this particular project, we create an algorithm which fits some Tetriminos
together into the smallest possible square, in the minimal amount of time,
despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities with each a piece
added.

`make clean`  | Remove objects files.
`make fclean` | Remove objects files and the binary.
